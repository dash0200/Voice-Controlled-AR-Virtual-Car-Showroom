# Voice-Controlled-Augmented-Reality-Virtual-Car
A common trend with AR courses is to demonstrate the technology by creating simple mini apps, projecting a 3D model on a surface in front of the user, this is usually done with an image target or possibly a ground plane.  Although this is... 'cool' it doesn't capitalize on the marketing power AR offers
